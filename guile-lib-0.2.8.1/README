* Guile-Lib

[[https://www.nongnu.org/guile-lib/][Guile-Lib]]
A repository of useful code written in Guile Scheme

** Description

Guile-Lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile
modules, allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic
Guile modules into a coherent library. Think "a down-scaled,
limited-scope CPAN for Guile".

Guile-Lib modules are well-documented and well-supported. Particularly
good modules might migrate from Guile-Lib into Guile itself, at some
point.

** Latest News

April 2024

Guile-Lib version 0.2.8.1 is released.

Visit the [[file:NEWS][NEWS]] file for the list of visible changes since the last
release, as well as older news.

** Savannah

Guile-Lib also has a Savannah [[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/guile-lib/][project page]].

General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
